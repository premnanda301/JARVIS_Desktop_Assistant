# Personal AI Assistant (Jarvis)

This project is a simple personal AI assistant that can recognize voice commands, search Wikipedia, open websites like YouTube and Google, tell the time, and open applications like Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio. The assistant uses voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to interact with the user.

## Features
- Voice-activated commands.
- Opens websites (e.g., YouTube, Google) in Chrome.
- Retrieves information from Wikipedia.
- Provides current time.
- Opens local applications (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio).

## Prerequisites

Before running the assistant, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome (if using the assistant to open websites)
- Required Python libraries (installed via `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

### Step 1: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.

#### For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install All Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Code

Once all dependencies are installed, run the `assistant.py` script.

```bash
python assistant.py
```

## Usage

After running the assistant, it will greet you and listen for commands. You can use voice commands such as:
- "Search Wikipedia for [your topic]"
- "Open YouTube"
- "Open Google"
- "Tell me the time"
- "Open Visual Studio Code"
- "Open Visual Studio"

The assistant will respond with voice output and perform the requested action.

## Note

For speech recognition, the assistant uses Google Speech Recognition. Ensure you have an active internet connection for this functionality.

## License

This project is open-source and free to use.
